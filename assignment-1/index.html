                <p>
                    “Wall” explores emotional distance, frustration, and the feeling
                    of being unheard. The song’s driving rhythm and introspective lyrics
                    capture the tension between wanting connection and feeling blocked
                    by invisible barriers.

                    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                    <p>
It's coming to a close
I guess I should know that I'm never gonna see you again
In a place that sells vintage clothes
I guess you should know that it hasn't been the easiest years
For a band all living in the throes </p>
 <p>[Pre-Chrous]</p>
                    <p>
And then I see a smile
Between repetitive aisles of flannel shirts
And I, I thought you would show
Like a beautiful ghost caught in a saving throw
                    </p>

                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
                    <p>
And I don't even care that it's over
And I don't even care there's a wall
And I will never look back for answers
And I won't ever look back at all
(It's coming to a close)
(It's coming to a close)
It's coming to a
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>[Verse 2]</p>
                    <p>
I guess I should know that the softer serif fades
The words remain as shown in the summer snow
Well, it hasn't been the easiest years
In a life that hasn't let you go</p>
                    <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
<p>
And then I see a smile
Between repetitive aisles of well-worn dirt
And I, I thought you would show
I thought you would show
I thought you would show
</p>
                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>
And I don't even care that it's over
And I don't even care, there's a wall
I won't ever look back for answers
And I won't ever look back, look back at all
</p>
                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
<p>
And I don't even care that it's over (I guess I should know, as the words remain)
And I don't even care, there's a wall (I guess I should know, as the words remain as shown)
I won't ever look back in anger (I guess I should know, as the words remain)
I won't ever look back, look back at all
</p>
                    <p>[Outro]</p>

It's coming to a close
It's coming to a close
It's coming to a close
It's coming to a...
