                <h2>About the Song</h2>
                <p>
                    “Wall” explores emotional distance and the frustration of feeling
                    blocked from meaningful connection. The song’s driving rhythm and
                    introspective lyrics mirror the tension between isolation and the
                    desire to be understood.

                <p>
                    Good Kid is an indie rock band known for blending energetic,
                    guitar-driven melodies with reflective storytelling. Their music
                    often pairs upbeat arrangements with themes of anxiety, identity,
                    and emotional distance.

                <p>
                    The artwork for “Wall” features illustrated cityscapes, layered
                    structures, and warm sunset gradients. These visual elements echo
                    the song’s themes of separation, height, and emotional barriers.

                <h2>Album Aesthetic</h2>
                <p>
                    Good Kid’s visual identity frequently uses hand-drawn textures,
                    muted urban colours, and playful imperfections. This aesthetic
                    reinforces the emotional honesty of their music while maintaining
                    a youthful indie tone.

                <blockquote>
                    <p>[Verse 1]</p>
                    <p>
                        It's coming to a close<br>
                        I guess I should know that I'm never gonna see you again<br>
                        In a place that sells vintage clothes<br>
                        I guess you should know that it hasn't been the easiest years<br>
                        For a band all living in the throes
                    </p>

                    <p>[Pre-Chorus]</p>
                    <p>
                        And then I see a smile<br>
                        Between repetitive aisles of flannel shirts<br>
                        And I, I thought you would show<br>
                        Like a beautiful ghost caught in a saving throw
                    </p>

                    <p>[Chorus]</p>
                    <p>
                        And I don't even care that it's over<br>
                        And I don't even care there's a wall<br>
                        And I will never look back for answers<br>
                        And I won't ever look back at all
                    </p>

                    <p>[Verse 2]</p>
                    <p>
                        I guess I should know that the softer serif fades<br>
                        The words remain as shown in the summer snow<br>
                        Well, it hasn't been the easiest years<br>
                        In a life that hasn't let you go
                    </p>

                    <p>[Outro]</p>
                    <p>
                        It's coming to a close<br>
                        It's coming to a close<br>
                        It's coming to a close
                    </p>
